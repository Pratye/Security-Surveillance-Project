# Security-Surveillance-Project

This project is a demo of how modern Home Security Surveillance Cameras can be designed to detect any sort theft or malicious person.

The project is based on object detection and uses a Machine Learning Model to detect different objects. The Machine learning Model was trained on a Yolo V4 model archetecture for over 4000 itereations. The model trained on 4000 images where each class had 1000 images. The model achieved an 97.99% accuracy on the test data set.
